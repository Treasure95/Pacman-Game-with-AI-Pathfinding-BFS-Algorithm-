# 👾 Pacman Game with AI Pathfinding (C++ & BFS)

A C++ desktop application that simulates a Pacman-style game with intelligent ghost movement using the **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** algorithm to calculate the shortest path in a maze.

This project explores core computer science concepts such as **graph traversal**, **pathfinding**, and **AI behavior in games**, all implemented from scratch without using external game engines.

## 🎮 Features

- ✅ Pacman-style grid-based maze
- 👻 Ghosts that use **BFS pathfinding** to chase Pacman
- 🔁 Real-time movement and dynamic AI behavior
- 🧠 BFS implementation for shortest-path planning
- 🕹️ Console-based gameplay (or GUI if applicable)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Language:** C++  
- **Concepts:** Graph Theory, BFS (Breadth-First Search), Game AI  
- **Tools:** Standard C++ libraries, IDE of choice (e.g., Code::Blocks, Visual Studio)

## 💡 Project Background

This game was developed as part of a university assignment focused on algorithmic problem-solving. The goal was to apply **Breadth-First Search** in a real-world scenario — enabling ghosts to find the shortest path to the player in a grid-based environment.

This pathfinding approach is widely used in:
- GPS navigation systems (e.g., Google Maps, Waze)
- Robotics and motion planning
- Multiplayer and AI-driven games
