# Pacman-Game-with-AI-Pathfinding-BFS-Algorithm-
A C++ desktop application that enhances a Pacman-style game by implementing Breadth-First Search (BFS) to calculate the shortest path for ghost enemies navigating a grid-based maze. The project demonstrates core concepts of graph traversal, AI pathfinding, and algorithmic problem-solving used in real-world applications like GPS and robotics.
